2.1. Can't add the method addDigitalVideoDisc which pass an arbitrary number for DVD because it has the same input type as above method. I prefer the previous method.
3.
- After call swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), 2 variables are swapped but only in the method (not reference) then it's doesn't change any variables which are outside of the method
- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the setTitle method is activated through reference to the jungleDVD object then the object has a new title.
- There is no available swap method unless swap all the attributes between these two.
